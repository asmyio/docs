### Solutions Architecture Overview

Solutions architects are a customer-facing role, owning the overall technical relationship and strategy between the customer and organization. They lead architectural design sessions, develop proof of concepts/pilots, implement projects, and deliver ongoing refinement and enhancement. Responsibilities for this role include advising stakeholders and translating business requirements into designs for secure, scalable, and reliable solutions.
